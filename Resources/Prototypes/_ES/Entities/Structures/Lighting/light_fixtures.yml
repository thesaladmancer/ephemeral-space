# Light fixtures used in ES maps -- separate from light tubes, which actually control the light values used
# (although all fixtures here have pointlights set to the same value as their default tubes, for visualizing lighting
# during the mapping process)

# Used in departments. Brighter light than hallways for contrast, and can be controlled by lightswitches
# Off by default. Intended flow is that lightswitches are off, then ppl come in and turn em on for vibes
